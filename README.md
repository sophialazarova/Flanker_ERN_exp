# Flanker_ERN_exp
Scripts accompanying ERN (Error-related negativity) investigation in EEG data during a Flanker experiment. Scripts contain preprocessing of the EEG data as well as the following analyses needed to test the running hypotheses. 
The actual raw EEG data is not included.



## Brief
With this report, we provide further evidence that the ERN is a direct manifestation of a conflict monitoring mechanism which can be observed when an erroneous action is taken. We assume that such a system will exhibit more pronounced activity when the accuracy is a condition of importance to the subject. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the amplitude of the ERN will vary according to the level of conflict present in the trial. Additionally, we measured the reaction time (RT) of the subjects and further speculated that lower RT is associated with lower presence of conflict and generally lower mental effort.
